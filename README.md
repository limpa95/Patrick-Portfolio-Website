The Yugioh image microservice was orginally created by my project partner, Thea Dinh, and was modified by me to be hosted online.

## Project Overview

This website was created using various technologies related to web development and demonstrates my proficiency and knowledge about it. It also includes a separate microservice that uses web scraping (Puppeteer) to lookup
images from the Yugioh card game.
